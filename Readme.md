#### Year 2 in Computer Science
### Object Oriented Programming Assingment 2


## Main idea
	The goal behind this assignment is to create a game that uses some form of physics.

## My plan
	I am yet to decide how or what I am going to create so for now I'll simply focus on the looks of the project and I will start working on the actual game as soon as inspiration hits me.
