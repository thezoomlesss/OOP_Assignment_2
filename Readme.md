# Concept
For the 2nd year assignment I figured out that I have to create something that shows that I put a lot of effort into and that I am capable of writing great code.
Therefore, I started trying to find difficult tasks that I can face and tackle.

# Why
I chose Stack Challenge because it involves a lot of collision and I felt like it was suitable for what I wanted to create and it was a difficult enough task. Therefore, it would be visible that I put effort into it.

#Controls

* W A S D for the movement
* F for toggling between the modes offered by the character
* MouseClick for teleporting ( IF YOU HAVE THE CHEATS ENABLED FROM THE SETTINGS )

# Features

* Screens
  * Name-Input
  * Menu
  * Instructions
  * Leaderboards	
  * Settings
  * Credits

* Gameplay
  * Collision
  * Pushing objects
  * Gravity
  * Teleportation
  * Climbing objects

* Other features
  * Leaderboard
  * Option to cheat
  * Scalability
  * Replayability
  * Nice music
  
# Key Notes

* All the physics is written by myself (collision, gravity, pushing and so on )
* File I/O with Leaderboard
* User input is present on the first screen
* Minim library used for the music
* Interfaces used twice 
* Polymorphism is present through various cases
* Inheritance is also present
* The use of abstract classes (twice)
* A lot of code refacturing goes on
